title: Code of Conduct
permalink: /code-of-conduct/

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
**Oden** community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are
committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect
our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may
be banned from the community.

Our open source community strives to:

* **Be friendly and welcoming.**
* **Be patient**: Remember that people have varying communication styles, speak
  different native languages and that misunderstandings occur.
* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports all,
  regardless of level of experience, ethnicity, social and economic class,
  appearance, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression,
  disability, age, religion, nationality or other similar characteristic.
* **Be respectful**:  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement
  is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
  feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* **Be careful in the words that we choose**: Be kind to others. Do not insult
  or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior
  aren't acceptable.
* **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements
  and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Focus on
  helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
* **Avoid destructive behavior**:
  * Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a
    new conversation.
  * Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs;
    try to offer suggestions as to how things may be improved.
  * Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
    behaviour is not welcome.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior — or have any other
concerns — please report it by contacting us via

discretion.
